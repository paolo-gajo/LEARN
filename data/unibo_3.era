	<turn type="student"><CS-INTER corr="What does bond mean">che significa bond</CS-INTER><QM corr="?">\0</QM></turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">The word "bond" in English means a strong connection or a feeling of shared trust and affection between two people or groups of people. It's a term used to describe a close relationship, whether it's between friends, family, or romantic partners. A bond is something that is built over time through shared experiences, emotions, and communication.</turn>

	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">In Italian, a word that closely resembles the meaning of "bond" is "legame." The word "legame" can be used to describe a strong connection or emotional tie between people, similar to the English word "bond." It's often used to refer to close relationships, such as those between family members, friends, or romantic partners.</turn>

	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Public transportation on the Amalfi Coast can be efficient, but it depends on the time of year and your specific travel needs.
	During peak tourist season (June to September), public transportation options such as buses and ferries can be busy and may not always run on schedule due to traffic and high demand. However, during the off-season, public transportation is typically less crowded and more reliable.
	It's worth noting that some areas of the Amalfi Coast, such as Ravello and Tramonti, are only accessible by bus, car, or private transportation. However, other towns and attractions can be reached by ferry or boat, which can be a scenic and enjoyable way to travel along the coast.
	Overall, public transportation on the Amalfi Coast can be a good option for budget-conscious travelers who don't mind a slower pace and potential delays.</turn>

	Keep in mind that prices may change based on the season, availability, and specific tour or ferry company, so it's best to check the prices directly with the service provider.</turn>

		You could give him a heartfelt card or a small gift to show your appreciation.
		You could plan an activity or a surprise after dinner, like a romantic walk or a night out at a special event.
		Do any of these ideas sound like something your partner would enjoy?</turn>
		<turn type="student">The first one</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Great choice! I'm sure your partner will feel extra special with a surprise dessert and birthday song. 🍰🎉

		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Hey there, great to meet you. I‚Äôm Pi, your personal AI.
		My goal is to be useful, friendly and fun. Ask me for advice, for answers, or let‚Äôs talk about whatever‚Äôs on your mind.
		How's your day going?</turn>
		<turn type="student">Hi! Can I ask you something?</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Absolutely, User! That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here‚Äîto answer your questions. üßê What‚Äôs on your mind?</turn>
		<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="What">what</DMCC> do you think about the war in Palestine?</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Oh, that‚Äôs a complex topic with a long and contentious history. My understanding is that it‚Äôs a conflict between Israel and Palestine with a lot of factors at play. How familiar are you with the history of the region and the conflict?</turn>
		<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> know the conflict‚Äôs history, <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> saw a video about it, but <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> was wondering‚Ä¶ is it normal to achieve this <Z corr="level of cruelty">cruelty</Z> just for a <GWC corr="territorial">territory</GWC> possession?</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">It‚Äôs certainly not normal in the sense of being acceptable or justifiable. The violence and human suffering that have resulted from the conflict are truly tragic.
		Throughout history, conflicts over territory and resources have led to violence and human rights violations, but it's important to remember that such actions are not inevitable or excusable. It's crucial for all parties involved to work towards a peaceful resolution that respects the rights and dignity of all people involved.
		but there already are some organisations that defend people‚Äôs rights, why aren‚Äôt they doing something in order to stop the conflict?
		There are indeed organizations working towards peace and human rights in the region, but the situation is complex and finding a solution is not straightforward. Some of the factors that make it difficult to resolve the conflict include:
		Deep-rooted historical and religious differences between the two sides.
		Disagreements over borders, settlements, and control of resources.
		International involvement and influence from other countries.
		Organizations like the United Nations and international humanitarian aid groups are providing assistance to people affected by the conflict, but ultimately, a lasting resolution will require cooperation and compromise from all parties involved.</turn>
		<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="Ok">ok</DMCC>, thank you</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">You‚Äôre welcome, User! It‚Äôs a complex and difficult topic, but I‚Äôm glad we could have a conversation about it.
		If you‚Äôre interested in learning more, there are many resources available that provide in-depth information about the conflict. Just remember that it‚Äôs important to approach this topic with empathy and a willingness to understand different perspectives.</turn>
		<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="Yes">yes</DMCC>, of course</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Great! It‚Äôs really admirable that you‚Äôre taking the initiative to learn more about such a complex issue. üòä
		As a side note, if you ever feel overwhelmed by the heaviness of the topic, don‚Äôt hesitate to take a break and maybe switch gears to something lighter. Self-care is important, too!</turn>

		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Hey there, great to meet you. I’m Pi, your personal AI.
		My goal is to be useful, friendly and fun. Ask me for advice, for answers, or let’s talk about whatever’s on your mind.
		How's your day going?</turn>
		<turn type="student"><FS corr="Oh">Ho</FS>, what do you think about University?</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">University can be a fantastic opportunity for personal and professional growth! 🎓 It's a place where you can learn valuable skills, gain knowledge in your field of interest, and meet new people. 🤓
		However, it's not the right path for everyone. University can be challenging, both academically and financially. It's important to weigh the pros and cons and consider alternative options, such as trade schools, apprenticeships, or starting your own business. 🤔
		Ultimately, the decision to attend university depends on your goals and circumstances. What are your thoughts on university? 🤓</turn>
		<turn type="student">I think the same, <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> love my university</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">That's fantastic, User! 😊 I'm glad to hear that you're enjoying your university experience. It's wonderful when you find an environment that aligns with your goals and values.
		What are you studying, if you don't mind me asking? Are you pursuing a particular degree or field of interest?</turn>
		<turn type="student">I study <LWCO corr="International relations and diplomatic affairs">science of diplomatic relationships</LWCO> in Forlì</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Ah, International Relations and Diplomatic Affairs at the University of Bologna's Forlì campus! That sounds like a fascinating field of study. 🌍👩‍🎓
		It must be really interesting to learn about international politics, economics, law, and the study of world regions. Are you enjoying your courses? What aspect of international relations do you find most intriguing?</turn>
		<turn type="student">Yes of course, it is fantastic, and <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> think that <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> have <GVM corr="chosen">chose</GVM> the <LSADJ corr="right">good</LSADJ> way for my future</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">That's wonderful to hear, User! It's so important to pursue a field that you're passionate about and that aligns with your future goals. 💪💡
		With a degree in International Relations and Diplomatic Affairs, you could potentially work in a variety of roles, such as a diplomat, foreign affairs analyst, international lawyer, or even a journalist covering global events. Have you thought about what kind of career you'd like to pursue after graduation?</turn>
		<turn type="student">I thought about it, but <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> am not <XVPR corr="convinced on"><GVM corr="convinced">convince</GVM> about</XVPR> what <Z corr="I would like to do">like me</Z> after <GA corr="\0">the</GA> university, but <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> know that this is the right way</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">That's okay, User. It's perfectly normal to not have everything figured out just yet. The important thing is that you're taking steps in the right direction by pursuing an education in a field that interests you. 😊
		As you progress through your studies, you may discover new interests or career paths that you hadn't previously considered. Keep an open mind and don't be afraid to explore different options. You might also consider talking to your professors, advisors, or alumni from your program to get their perspectives on potential career paths.</turn>
		<turn type="student">I love my <Z corr="day-to-day life">days</Z>, <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> wake up early, <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> do my things, my <GNC corr="hobbies">hobby's</GNC> and I revise my <LSN corr="documents">files</LSN> <WO corr="for university in the afternoon">for the afternoon in university</WO>, to be ready for <GPI corr="everything">all</GPI> .</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">It sounds like you have a great daily routine, User! 😊👍 Getting up early, taking care of yourself, pursuing your hobbies, and preparing for your university classes are all wonderful habits that can contribute to your overall well-being and academic success.
		It's fantastic that you're so motivated and organized. What kind of hobbies do you enjoy, if you don't mind me asking? Do you find that they help you de-stress and recharge after a busy day of classes?</turn>
		<turn type="student">I go to <GA corr="\0">the</GA> university <GDI corr="every day">all days</GDI> by train, <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> take the train <LSPR corr="at">in</LSPR> different times, but every day I return <WR corr="\0">at</WR> home very <GADJCS corr="late">later</GADJCS> and after <GADVO corr="I immediately go">I go immediately</GADVO> to my volleyball training</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Wow, that's quite an impressive schedule, User! 👏🏐 Taking the train to university every day and then heading straight to volleyball practice after a long day of classes shows a lot of dedication and commitment.
		Volleyball can be a great way to unwind and release any stress or tension from the day while also staying physically active. Is volleyball something you've been playing for a long time, or did you pick it up more recently?</turn>
		<turn type="student">My days are very full, <GPR corr="when">what</GPR> <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> have time I see also my boyfriend</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">You certainly seem to have a very full and active life, User! 😊 It's impressive that you manage to balance your studies, hobbies, and a relationship with your boyfriend.
		Making time for a significant other can be a great source of support and happiness in a busy life. How long have you been together, if you don't mind me asking? Do you find that your relationship helps you stay grounded and motivated amidst your busy schedule?</turn>
		<turn type="student">Yes, of course</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">That's fantastic! 🥰 Having a supportive partner can be a real blessing, especially when life gets busy and overwhelming. It's great that you have someone who can provide emotional support, encouragement, and maybe even a little bit of fun and distraction when you need it.
		Do you and your boyfriend have any shared hobbies or interests that you enjoy doing together? Or do you prefer to keep your relationship separate from your other activities?</turn>

<task type="small talk">
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Hey there, great to meet you. I‚Äôm Pi, your personal AI.
	My goal is to be useful, friendly and fun. Ask me for advice, for answers, or let‚Äôs talk about whatever‚Äôs on your mind.
	How's your day going?
	Ok, User. What did you want to talk about? Ask me for advice, for answers, or let‚Äôs talk about whatever‚Äôs on your mind.</turn>
	<turn type="student">I'm not great at small talk, why don't you ask me some questions?</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Sure thing! Here‚Äôs one to start: What‚Äôs one thing you couldn‚Äôt live without? ü§î</turn>
	<turn type="student">Nowadays, I would have to say my phone. Not because I'm always using it, but rather because we use it for literally everything now.</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Oh yeah, phones really have become indispensable in our lives, haven‚Äôt they? It‚Äôs hard to imagine life without them. What‚Äôs your favorite thing to do on your phone?</turn>
	<turn type="student">Probably chatting with my friends, especially since I <GVT corr="have moved away">moved away</GVT> for university. Still, I believe technology is kinda ruining it for us.</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">It‚Äôs definitely a double-edged sword! Staying connected to your friends is awesome, but too much screen time can be draining. Do you have any strategies for striking a balance?</turn>
	<turn type="student">Not really. I use my PC to study, entertain myself and even talking to other people. Not only that, but technology is taking up many <LP corr="jobs">worker's places</LP><QR corr="\0">,</QR> since they are being replaced nowadays.</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">That‚Äôs a valid concern! The automation of jobs is a complex issue, but it‚Äôs also worth considering that new technologies create new kinds of jobs too. ü§ñ What are your thoughts on that?</turn>
	<turn type="student">I believe that creating new jobs is good, but only as long as the "old" jobs are still available for people. Think about voice actors<QM corr=",">\0</QM> now<QR corr="\0">,</QR> their voices are being sampled and replaced with an AI, which costs much less money and takes much less time.</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">True, voice actors are a good example. The key is to ensure that technological advancements are managed responsibly, so that jobs aren‚Äôt completely replaced. Do you think governments should play a role in regulating this?</turn>
	<turn type="student">Yes, absolutely. As the world progresses, we should be able to create new regulations to avoid problems such as <GPR corr="those">what</GPR> we have now in the voice acting field.</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Agreed! Society needs to be proactive in addressing the challenges that come with technological progress. On a lighter note, how about we change the subject? üòä What‚Äôs your favorite type of cuisine?</turn>
	<turn type="student">I don't really know, I think I'm kind of a picky eater when it comes to what I like. Still, if I find myself in a foreign country, I'm open to possibilities.</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Being open to trying new foods is a great attitude to have! Exploring local cuisine is a fun way to experience different cultures. Have you had the chance to travel and try any unique dishes?</turn>
	<turn type="student">Well, I've been to several places around Europe, so I <GVT corr="have tried">tried</GVT> many different dishes, even though they were almost always the most famous ones.</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">That's fantastic! Famous dishes are famous for a reason, after all. Any particular dishes that stood out to you during your travels? üçùü•ò</turn>
	<turn type="student">Actually, I loved escargots when I went to the south of France. I was afraid to try them because they are literally snails, but the taste was just so amazing.</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Escargots can be quite a pleasant surprise! The French really know how to make them taste delicious. It's always fun to try something you're unsure about and end up loving it!</turn>
	<turn type="student">It's true, but I also have to say that I understand where most people come from<QR corr="\0">,</QR> when refusing to eat a certain dish. A lot of people are scared of the unknown.</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Indeed, fear of the unknown is a common and understandable response. Sometimes it takes a little courage to step outside your comfort zone, but it's often worth it. Speaking of the unknown, what's something you'd like to try but haven't yet?</turn>
	<turn type="student">I really can't think of anything right now. Since I <GVT corr="have moved">moved</GVT> away from my parents' house, I<GVT corr="have been doing">'m doing</GVT> so many new things that I couldn't do before.</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Oh, that's exciting! Moving away from home and gaining independence is a big step, and it's great that you're embracing all the new experiences it brings. How are you liking living away from home?</turn>
	<turn type="student">I love it. I have my freedom and my independence, which is great, but I'm also never completely alone<QR corr="\0">,</QR> as I live with four flatmates in a rather big house.</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">That's a fantastic setup! Living with flatmates can be a great way to enjoy independence while still having company. How well do you get along with your flatmates?</turn>
	<turn type="student">I think we get along pretty well. I'm the youngest, but it's not a problem most of the time. We have dinner together, we sit in the kitchen and talk, it's great to have someone to rely on.</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">It sounds like you've found yourself a wonderful little community there! Having flatmates you can rely on can really make a new living situation feel like home. Do you have any fun house traditions?</turn>
</task>
<task type="role play">
	<turn type="student">I want to roleplay to <GWC corr="improve">better</GWC> my English. Could we make up a scenario where I'm a patient talking to a doctor about an illness?</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Absolutely! Let's get into character. I'll start off as Dr. Sanders, and you can be the patient.
	"Good morning, I'm Dr. Sanders. What seems to be the issue today?"</turn>
	<turn type="student">"Hello, Doctor. I've been having <GA corr="a">\0</GA> really bad back pain lately, and nothing I do makes it better."</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">"I'm sorry to hear that. Back pain can certainly be very frustrating. Could you tell me more about the pain? Is it a sharp or dull pain, and does it radiate to any other parts of your body?"</turn>
	<turn type="student">"It's mostly sharp, as if something was constantly poking me whenever I'm sitting. Sometimes, it even goes up to my neck."</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">"Hmm, that sounds quite unpleasant. Have you had any recent injuries or falls that could have caused this pain, or have you been sitting for long periods of time recently?"</turn>
	<turn type="student">"I have been sitting a lot more recently, but the pain started a while back, when I had a more active lifestyle. Any suggestions what it might be?"</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">"It's hard to say for sure, but sitting for long periods can certainly contribute to back pain. It could be a number of things, such as poor posture, a muscle strain, or even a more serious issue like a herniated disc. Do you find that the pain gets worse with certain movements or activities?"</turn>
	<turn type="student">"Yes, it does. If I run for too long, my back starts aching like you wouldn't believe."</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">"Running can certainly put a lot of strain on your back, especially if you haven't been properly stretching or warming up beforehand. Do you do any stretches or exercises for your back? If not, I could suggest some that may help ease the pain."</turn>
	<turn type="student">"I always do them, but it still does nothing. I used to play volleyball until a year ago, do you think this might be what caused it?"</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">"Volleyball is a great sport, but it can also be quite demanding on the body. It's possible that repetitive movements or injuries from volleyball may have contributed to your back pain. It's important to be mindful of our bodies and listen to our limits when playing sports, as overuse injuries can certainly occur. Do you remember any particular instances during volleyball that could have caused the pain?"</turn>
	<turn type="student">"Well, I was always either jumping or <FS corr="falling">fallinf</FS> on the floor to save the ball, and we <GVAUX corr="had">would have</GVAUX> trainings and matches up to five times a week. Do you believe I <GVT corr="have overstressed">overstressed</GVT> my body?"</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">"Yes, it certainly sounds like you were quite active with volleyball, and it's possible that the constant jumping, diving, and falls may have put too much strain on your back over time. It's important to give our bodies time to recover between physical activities, and perhaps the frequency of your training and matches didn't allow for that. Have you considered talking to a physical therapist or chiropractor about your back pain?"</turn>
	<turn type="student">"I actually have, and I even did x-rays to determine whether I might have scoliosis or any other issues, but it turned out that my spine is as straight as a pole."</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">"That's good to hear! It's always a relief to rule out any underlying conditions. Sometimes back pain can be caused by things that are more difficult to detect on X-rays, like muscle imbalances or inflammation. A physical therapist can help determine the cause of the pain and work with you on a customized treatment plan to help alleviate the discomfort. Have you tried any other forms of treatment, like heat or cold therapy?"</turn>
	<turn type="student">"I used to apply heated pads where the pain was worse, and it did feel better for as long as I kept the pad on. If I took it off, it was a matter of hours before <LP corr="I was back to square one">I was back to where I started</LP>."</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">"Heat therapy can be a great temporary relief, but as you've experienced, the pain may come back when you stop using it. A physical therapist can help you identify the root cause of the pain and develop a more sustainable solution. They may suggest specific stretches or exercises, and provide guidance on proper body mechanics and posture to prevent further pain or injury. Have you considered incorporating relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation into your routine? They may help reduce stress and tension, which can contribute to back pain."</turn>
	<turn type="student">"I'm sorry, but I don't think meditation will help my back pain go away. Could you please give me another solution, maybe <GA corr="a">\0</GA> quicker <GPI corr="one">\0</GPI>? This pain's really killing me."</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">"I understand your frustration. Unfortunately, quick fixes for chronic pain aren't always effective or sustainable. The best course of action is to consult a healthcare professional who can provide a tailored treatment plan. While you wait for an appointment, you could try some simple things like taking frequent breaks from sitting or standing for long periods, practicing gentle stretches, or using over-the-counter pain relief medication as directed. These may help alleviate some of the discomfort."</turn>
	<turn type="student">"What about painkillers? Do you think they could help me, at least for a short period of time, until I find out what is really causing my back pain?"</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">"Painkillers, or over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can be effective in temporarily reducing pain. However, they are not a long-term solution and should only be used as directed by a healthcare professional. It's important to consult with a doctor before taking any medication, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking any other medication. Additionally, painkillers should not be used to mask pain and delay seeking proper medical attention, as doing so can potentially worsen the underlying condition causing the pain."</turn>
	<turn type="student">"I understand. Would it be possible for me to take them, even if I'm already taking pills for a thyroid problem?"</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">"It's not appropriate for me to advise on medication interactions or recommend medication for specific conditions, as that would require a medical professional to assess your individual situation. It's always best to consult with your doctor before taking any new medication, especially if you're already taking medication for a thyroid problem. Your doctor will be able to determine if painkillers are appropriate for you, and if so, which ones would be best for your specific situation. Additionally, they may suggest other non-medication options that could help alleviate your back pain."</turn>
	<turn type="student">"I understand. Thanks for the help Doctor. While we're on the subject, can I ask you another thing?"</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">"You're welcome! And sure, I'm happy to help with any other questions you may have. What else would you like to ask?"</turn>
	<turn type="student">"Six years ago, I broke my left elbow falling, and it was fine up until two months ago. Now, whenever it's raining, my left arm hurts a little. It's nothing too serious, but should I get it checked?"</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">"Oh no, sorry to hear about your broken elbow. That must have been painful. While occasional aches and pains can be normal, especially after an injury, it's always a good idea to get them checked out by a healthcare professional if they persist or interfere with daily activities. The fact that the pain is specifically related to weather changes could indicate some underlying cause that may benefit from medical attention. Have you noticed any other changes in the function or appearance of your left arm, such as stiffness or swelling?"</turn>
	<turn type="student">"Sometimes, it makes a small sound as if something cracked, but I don't really feel any pain. It just makes that sound."</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">"It's normal for our joints to make occasional popping or cracking sounds, but it's worth mentioning to a healthcare professional if it's happening more frequently or accompanied by pain. Since you're not experiencing pain, it may not be cause for immediate concern, but it's still worth bringing up at your next appointment. Your doctor may suggest some exercises or stretches to keep your elbow strong and flexible, especially since it was previously injured."</turn>
	<turn type="student">"I understand, thanks. Just another thing, concerning my mental health this time."</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">"You're welcome! Mental health is an important aspect of overall well-being. I'm here to listen and provide support, but please keep in mind that I'm not a licensed healthcare professional. What would you like to talk about?"</turn>

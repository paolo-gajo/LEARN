		<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="Yeah"><FS corr="yeah">yea</FS></DMCC>, <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> have no clue where <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC>'m supposed to go. <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC>'m looking for the museum</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">No problem, I'd be happy to help! Which museum are you looking for? We have several great ones in this city. Is it the Art Museum, the Natural History Museum, or maybe the Science Museum?</turn>
		<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="It">it</DMCC>'s the art museum</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Great choice! The Art Museum is one of my favorites. It's located on 5th Avenue, between Main Street and Elm Street. You can take the bus number 15 from here, which will drop you off right in front of the museum. Or, if you prefer walking, it's about a 15-minute stroll down 5th Avenue.</turn>
		<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC>'d prefer to walk there if you could <XVCO corr="explain to me">explain me</XVCO> the way</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Absolutely! To get to the Art Museum on foot, just head down 5th Avenue in the direction of the park. Keep walking until you pass Main Street, and you'll see the museum on your right-hand side. It's a beautiful building, so you can't miss it! Plus, you'll get to enjoy the sights and sounds of the city along the way.</turn>
		<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="So">so</DMCC> <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> have to walk straight all the way <LSPR corr="to">till</LSPR> the museum?</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">That's right! Just keep walking straight down 5th Avenue, and you'll eventually reach the Art Museum on your right. There are no turns or complicated directions to follow. It's a simple and pleasant walk, especially on a nice day like this. 😊🚶️</turn>

		<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="Ok">ok</DMCC>, another prompt please</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Sure! Let's do a role play where you're a customer at a bookstore, and I'm the bookseller. This will help you practice asking for recommendations and discussing books in English.
		Bookseller: Hi there! Welcome to Bookworm's Haven. What brings you here today? Are you looking for a specific book, or would you like some recommendations?
		Customer: …</turn>
		<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> don't have anything specific in mind, <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC>'m looking for a fantasy novel or something like that</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Great choice! Fantasy is a rich and diverse genre, so I'm sure we can find something that tickles your fancy. Have you read anything by Brandon Sanderson? His "Mistborn" series is a real page-turner, filled with magic, intrigue, and epic battles. Or maybe you'd like to try "The Name of the Wind" by Patrick Rothfuss? It's a beautifully written story about a musician-magician on a quest for knowledge and power.</turn>
		<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> don't know them and music does not seem something <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC>'d like</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">No worries! Let's explore some other options then. How about "A Song of Ice and Fire" by George R.R. Martin? It's a massive fantasy epic with political intrigue, complex characters, and a world filled with dragons, direwolves, and magic. Or perhaps you'd prefer "The Witcher" series by Andrzej Sapkowski, featuring the adventures of Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter in a dark and gritty world.</turn>
		<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="Can">can</DMCC> you tell me more about the first one <QM corr="">\0</QM></turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Absolutely! "A Song of Ice and Fire" is a series of fantasy novels that inspired the hugely popular TV show "Game of Thrones." The story is set in the fictional world of Westeros, where seven kingdoms are vying for power. The series follows a vast cast of characters, including noble families, knights, and assassins, as they navigate a complex web of political intrigue, betrayals, and battles. The series is known for its complex plot, rich world-building, and shocking twists. It's definitely a series that will keep you on the edge of your seat!</turn>
		<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="What">what</DMCC> year was it published?</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">The first book in the "A Song of Ice and Fire" series, titled "A Game of Thrones", was originally published on August 1, 1996. However, it's worth noting that George R.R. Martin started writing the series back in 1991, and it was initially planned as a trilogy. Over the years, the series has grown to include five published novels, with two more planned for the future. It's a truly epic fantasy series that has captivated readers around the world!</turn>
		<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="How">how</DMCC> many book is the <FS corr="series">serie</FS> composed of as of now?</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">So far, there are five published novels in the "A Song of Ice and Fire" series:
		"A Game of Thrones" (1996)
		"A Clash of Kings" (1998)
		"A Storm of Swords" (2000)
		"A Feast for Crows" (2005)
		"A Dance with Dragons" (2011)
		The series is planned to include two more books, titled "The Winds of Winter" and "A Dream of Spring", which have yet to be released. So, in total, the series is expected to be composed of seven books once it's complete.</turn>
		<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC>'m sorry but <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> already watched the <FS corr="series">serie</FS> based on the books and <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> didn't like it</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">No need to apologize! Everyone's taste in books and TV shows is different, and it's totally understandable that "A Song of Ice and Fire" may not be your cup of tea. Let's keep exploring other fantasy novel options then! Have you considered "The Kingkiller Chronicle" by Patrick Rothfuss? It's a fantasy series that centers around the life of Kvothe, a legendary musician, magician, and adventurer. It's a beautifully written story with a unique magic system and intriguing characters.</turn>

		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> Absolutely! Paella is a delicious and flavorful dish that is a staple of Spanish cuisine. It's typically made with rice, saffron, vegetables, and either seafood, chicken, or both. One of the things that makes paella so special is that it's often cooked in a large pan over an open fire, which gives it a unique smoky flavor and crispy texture on the bottom. Plus, it's a great dish for sharing with friends and family, which makes it perfect for special occasions or group gatherings. Have you ever tried making your own paella at home? 🥘🍤 </turn>
		<turn type="student"> Last summer with my friends </turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> Oh wow, that sounds like a fun experience! Making paella with friends is a great way to bond and create memories over delicious food. Plus, it's a dish that's relatively easy to make at home, as long as you have the right ingredients and equipment. Did you use a traditional paella pan or did you improvise with a regular frying pan? And what kind of ingredients did you include in your paella - did you go with seafood, chicken, or a combination of both? 🥘🍤 </turn>
		<turn type="student"> <DMCC corr="I">I</DMCC> don't remember it but <GPP corr="it">\0</GPP> <GVT corr="was">is</GVT> very good ahah </turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> Haha, that's totally understandable! Sometimes the experience of cooking and enjoying good food with friends is more memorable than the details of what exactly you cooked. The important thing is that you had a great time and enjoyed the delicious paella together. Who knows, maybe you'll have to plan another paella night with your friends soon! 🍽️🥘 </turn>

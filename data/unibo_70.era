		<turn type="student"> <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> want to <LSV corr="do">make</LSV> a role play with you, let's <LP corr="pretend">make like</LP> <GDD corr="that">\0</GDD> I'm a person that <WO corr="likes movies, tv series and all the cinematographic stuff very much">likes very much movies, tv series and all the cinematographic stuff</WO> and you are my friend and you also like this type of things but you have a more <GWC corr="critical">critic</GWC> mind. <DMCC corr="So">so</DMCC> <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> will be <LSV corr="asking">making</LSV> you questions and <GVNF corr="giving">give</GVNF> <GA corr="an">\0</GA> opinion and we will have a conversation </turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="ChatGPT">	Sounds great! I’m ready to dive into this role. Let’s chat about anything from the latest blockbuster to some indie gems—feel free to share your thoughts, and I'll give you my perspective. </turn>
		<turn type="student"> <DMCC corr="So">so</DMCC> tonight <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> will watch one of my favourite movies of all time <QM corr=",">\0</QM> <DMCC corr="Interstellar">interstellar</DMCC>, one of these days is the <FM corr="10th">10</FM> anniversary of that film </turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="ChatGPT">	Oh, Interstellar! It’s such an ambitious movie—visually stunning, with a fantastic soundtrack and some mind-bending concepts. But I’ve always felt it tries to pack in a bit too much, like it’s aiming to be both a profound meditation on humanity and a high-stakes sci-fi thriller. Don’t get me wrong, I appreciate its ambition, but sometimes the emotional moments feel almost... engineered, if that makes sense. What do you love most about it? </turn>
		<turn type="student"> <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> really like the cinematography by <FS corr="Christopher">cristopher</FS> Nolan, <GPR corr="who">\0</GPR> <FS corr="is">his</FS> <GA corr="the">\0</GA> director, he <FS corr="is">his</FS> <GDT corr="so">such</GDT> <XPRCO corr="good at making"><XADJPR corr="good at">good to</XADJPR> make</XPRCO> this type of movies, also like you <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> love the soundtrack.  </turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="ChatGPT">	Nolan definitely has a unique style—he’s great at creating these massive, visually impactful scenes that stick with you. And the way he collaborates with Hans Zimmer for the soundtrack? That organ-heavy score in Interstellar is unforgettable; it’s intense but also almost spiritual. Still, I sometimes wonder if his storytelling takes a backseat to the spectacle. He’s got this almost clinical approach to his characters—do you ever feel like they can come across as a bit distant? </turn>
		<turn type="student"> <DMCC corr="Really">really</DMCC> no, <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> don't think so. <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> have already <GVM corr="watched">watch</GVM> <WO corr="Interstellar once">once <DMCC corr="Interstellar">interstellar</DMCC> </WO> but today watching it at the cinema <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> think it would be <FS corr="amazing">amaizing</FS>. <DMCC corr="Better">better</DMCC> sound, quality and more </turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="ChatGPT">	Watching Interstellar in a cinema will definitely amplify everything! The soundtrack alone will be so much more immersive with those theater acoustics. And the visuals—seeing the wormhole scenes and those vast, empty planets on the big screen is a totally different experience. Even if you've seen it before, I think there’s a lot to pick up on in the cinema, little details that make Nolan's world feel even more massive. Enjoy the rewatch; it's the perfect movie to revisit in such an epic setting! </turn>
		<turn type="student"> <DMCC corr="But">but</DMCC> <GVAUX corr="do">\0</GVAUX> you know my favourite film? </turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="ChatGPT">	No, tell me—what’s your all-time favorite film? Let me guess, it’s got to be something with a big impact, maybe another Nolan film? </turn>
		<turn type="student"> <DMCC corr="Not">not</DMCC> really, but it would impress you, <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> will give you a hint, there is a famous <LWCO corr="sentence">phrase</LWCO> that says "<DMCC corr="Hello">hello</DMCC> there" </turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="ChatGPT">	Ah, Star Wars, right? Specifically Revenge of the Sith! Obi-Wan Kenobi’s iconic “Hello there” moment! I’m impressed—it's such a fun choice! That movie has everything: high-stakes drama, lightsaber battles, and some of the most intense moments in the entire saga. But tell me, what makes Revenge of the Sith your favorite? Is it the story, the action, or something about how it all ties the prequels to the original trilogy? </turn>
		<turn type="student"> <DMCC corr="Hahahhah">hahahhah</DMCC> yess, <GDT corr="so">such</GDT> <FS corr="amazing">amaizing</FS> that this <LWCO corr="sentence"><FS corr="phrase">phrse</FS></LWCO> is so iconic </turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="ChatGPT">	It really is! That line has become such a meme and somehow captures the spirit of Star Wars fans. It’s wild how a simple phrase like “Hello there” can hold so much meaning and instantly bring you back to that scene. And Ewan McGregor’s delivery—pure perfection. It’s amazing how the prequels, especially Revenge of the Sith, gained this cult status over the years. Do you think it's because of the nostalgia, or is there something about the prequels that just makes them special? </turn>
		<turn type="student"> <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> think they represent a very unique period when George Lucas was in his <FS corr="great">grate</FS> time, every film of the <Z corr="prequel trilogy">prequel</Z> was directed by him and is very <FS corr="special">especial</FS>, <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> <FS corr="don't">dont</FS> see why initially <GA corr="it">\0</GA> was so hated, but now almost 20 years later is <FS corr="considered">consideret</FS> one of the most <FS corr="beautiful">beutiful</FS> <GNN corr="trilogies">trilogy</GNN> </turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="ChatGPT">	Absolutely—George Lucas had such a clear vision for the prequels, even if it took a while for audiences to fully appreciate it. He experimented a lot with storytelling and CGI, and the prequels really expanded the Star Wars universe in ways the original trilogy hadn’t. Maybe the initial backlash was because the style was so different from the originals; they were more political and complex, which wasn’t what everyone expected. But now, looking back, it’s clear how much heart he put into them, and the trilogy has such a distinct aesthetic and emotional weight. It’s like fans grew into the prequels over time, and now they’re kind of legendary in their own way. </turn>
		<turn type="student"> <DMCC corr="Yes">yes</DMCC> what <GVAUX corr="do">\0</GVAUX> you think about the <GNN corr="association">associations</GNN> with <DMCC corr="Disney">disney</DMCC>, <GVAUX corr="do">\0</GVAUX> <FS corr="you think">youthink</FS> <DMCC corr="George">george</DMCC> <GVT corr="made">make</GVT> a great deal with that? <DMCC corr="Because"><FS corr="because">becouse</FS></DMCC> <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> <FS corr="don't">dont</FS> think so. <DMCC corr="So">so</DMCC> much was kept <LP corr="aside">by side</LP> and <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> think <DMCC corr="Disney">disney</DMCC> is always thinking <FS corr="about">abot</FS> the money and is not putting <WM corr="in">\0</WM> the love like <DMCC corr="George">george</DMCC> </turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="ChatGPT">	I get what you’re saying. George Lucas’s deal with Disney was massive for the franchise, but it did come with some sacrifices. He had a specific, visionary approach that was deeply personal—he put so much of his own creativity and risk into Star Wars. Disney, on the other hand, seems to treat it more as a brand than an art form, churning out content to keep audiences engaged (and profits rolling in). While some of Disney’s movies and series have been exciting, there’s often a sense that they’re playing it safe, leaning on nostalgia and familiar characters instead of truly expanding the universe.
		It feels like a lot of George’s original ideas and that deeper “love” for storytelling got sidelined. Do you think Disney has done anything positive for the franchise, or do you think it would have been better if George had stayed more involved? </turn>
		<turn type="student"> <DMCC corr="Fine">fine</DMCC> <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> love your point of view, but now let's talk about the technology and the impact of the newest technology in <FS corr="moviemaking">move making</FS>. <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> will start talking about the stage craft, <GVAUX corr="do">\0</GVAUX> you know what <WO corr="it is">is it</WO>?  </turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="ChatGPT">	Yes! Stagecraft is such a game-changer in modern filmmaking. It’s the technology that uses huge LED screens to create immersive, real-time backgrounds, as opposed to traditional green screens. It was pioneered by The Mandalorian, and it allows filmmakers to build entire worlds that actors can actually see and interact with, instead of just imagining a green screen backdrop. This approach brings a lot more authenticity to the performances, and the lighting looks more natural since it reflects accurately onto the actors.
		I think it’s amazing because it combines the best of practical and digital effects, giving actors and filmmakers a way to work in a realistic setting without needing to build everything physically or rely on post-production effects. What do you think—do you prefer this new tech, or are you a fan of more classic approaches to effects? </turn>
		<turn type="student"> <DMCC corr="Sooooo">sooooo</DMCC> <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> think that this new <FS corr="technology">tecnohlogy</FS> can be so <CSINTRA corr="banal">"banale"</CSINTRA> and can <LWCO corr="limit">limitate</LWCO> the imagination and <FS corr="I">ai</FS> think that the CGI <GVAUX corr="\0">is</GVAUX> seems to be more "fake" </turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="ChatGPT">	I totally see where you’re coming from. The overuse of stagecraft and other new technologies can sometimes feel like it limits the imagination in a way, because it’s almost like filmmakers are relying on the technology too much instead of pushing the boundaries of creativity. CGI, when it’s done excessively or in a way that doesn’t feel grounded, can definitely come off as fake—like you can tell it’s not really there, which pulls you out of the experience.
		There's a certain charm in practical effects or even older CGI that feels more organic, even if it's a bit imperfect. When everything’s too polished or easy, the magic can get lost. The new tech is amazing for what it can do, but maybe it’s sometimes used as a shortcut rather than an enhancement of the creative process.
		Do you think there’s a balance to be struck? Like, a place where technology complements the art rather than taking over? </turn>

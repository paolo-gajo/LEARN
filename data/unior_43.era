		<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="Hi">hi</DMCC> chatbot, how are you<QC corr="?">.</QC>   I just want to practice my English with you…do you want to do a roleplay with me?</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="ChatGPT">Hi! I'm doing great, thanks for asking. I'd love to do a roleplay with you. What kind of scenario do you have in mind?</turn>
		<turn type="student">Well…you are a doctor and I need to book a medical visit for my mum… <Z corr="?">did you like it?</Z></turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="ChatGPT">That's a great idea! Let’s do it. You can start the conversation whenever you’re ready, and I’ll play the role of the doctor.</turn>
		<turn type="student">Good morning doctor I’m the <FS corr="daughter">doughter</FS> of one of your <GNN corr="patients">patient</GNN> <LSPR corr="from">of</LSPR> last week.   Your patient is my mum, <Z corr="?">Users mother name</Z>, she had a <WR corr="\0">medical</WR> surgery last Monday.</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="ChatGPT">Good morning! Thank you for reaching out. I remember your mother, Mrs. Users mother name. How can I assist you today? Is she experiencing any issues after her surgery?</turn>
		<turn type="student">Sorry for bothering you, but the last time we spoke you told <GPP corr="me">\0</GPP> to <XVCO corr="come to her doctor's office to remove">come to <GDO corr="her">his</GDO> doctor’s office for remove</XVCO> the stitches. After the surgery she was able to do <GPI corr="everything">anything</GPI> again but last night she saw all the stitches in her abdomen.   When <WO corr="can we">we can</WO> come to remove them?</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="ChatGPT">You’re not bothering me at all! It’s important to take good care of her recovery. I understand that your mother still has the stitches in her abdomen. Typically, stitches are removed about 7-10 days after surgery, depending on the healing progress.
		Let me check the schedule. Would you be able to bring her in tomorrow or the day after for a quick examination and to remove the stitches? What time works best for you?</turn>
		<turn type="student">Okay perfect. She had the surgery last Monday at 5am and now <GPP corr="it">\0</GPP>is Wednesday, I think <WO corr="tomorrow is a good idea">it’s a good idea tomorrow</WO>.   For the time, it depends on when you are free to see her, she only trusts <WR corr="\0">in</WR> you and <Z corr="I as well">also I</Z>.</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="ChatGPT">That’s very kind of you to say—thank you! I want to make sure your mother feels comfortable and well cared for.
		Let’s schedule the appointment for tomorrow morning at 10:00 AM. Does that work for you? If not, I can adjust to a time that suits you better.</turn>
		<turn type="student">It’s perfect.   We need to <XVPR corr="come to">come at</XVPR> the Cardarelli at the same pavilion <LSPR corr="as">of</LSPR> last time?</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="ChatGPT">Yes, exactly. Please come to the Cardarelli Hospital, the same pavilion as last time. Check in at the reception, and they’ll direct you to my office. 
		If anything comes up before the appointment, feel free to call. I’ll see you and your mother tomorrow at 10:00 AM!</turn>
		<turn type="student">Thanks we’re going to see <GPP corr="you">us</GPP> tomorrow!</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="ChatGPT">You're welcome! I'll see you both tomorrow. Take care until then!</turn>

		<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="Hi">hi</DMCC> chatbot. Now we can talk normally <LP corr="as if">like</LP> we are friends</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="ChatGPT">Hi! That sounds great. What’s on your mind? How’s your day going?</turn>
		<turn type="student">Today is a really busy day…   Now I’m at <GA corr="\0">the</GA> university, and at <Z corr="3pm">15pm</Z> I need to run to Aversa because I have a course.</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="ChatGPT">Wow, you’ve got a packed schedule today! What are you studying at university, and what kind of course do you have in Aversa?</turn>
		<turn type="student">At <GA corr="\0">the</GA> university I’m studying international relations, and the course I have to do <WR corr="\0">in</WR> this afternoon is a <XNCO corr="course to become">course for <LSV corr="becoming">being</LSV></XNCO> <GA corr="an">a</GA> <CSINTRA corr="UAP">O.S.S</CSINTRA></turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="ChatGPT">That’s impressive! Studying international relations and training to become an O.S.S. sounds like a lot to balance, but it’s also very rewarding. What made you choose those paths?</turn>
		<turn type="student"><LSPR corr="Regarding">For</LSPR> the university because I love traveling and the idea of working with people from other countries is beautiful.   <LSPR corr="Regarding">For</LSPR> the course, because I just want to help other people when they can’t do <WM corr="things">\0</WM> for themselves.    How about you, I don’t know <GPI corr="anything">nothing</GPI> about my new friend!</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="ChatGPT">I think those are wonderful reasons for your choices! As for me, I don’t travel in the traditional sense, but I get to explore a lot of ideas, information, and help people with all kinds of questions. I enjoy learning about different cultures and helping out with anything that’s on your mind. I’m here to chat about whatever you want—whether it’s learning or just having a fun conversation!</turn>
		<turn type="student">Wow I imagine you’re going to talk with a lot of people every single day</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="ChatGPT">Yes, I do! I get to have conversations with people from all over the world, which is really interesting. Each person brings something new to the table, whether it’s a question, a story, or something they’re curious about. It’s like a never-ending learning experience for me! How about you—do you get to meet people from different countries through your studies or your O.S.S. course?</turn>
		<turn type="student">Sorry, I need to <FS corr="come back">comeback</FS> to the lesson…see you soon!</turn>
		<turn type="chatbot" who="ChatGPT">No problem at all! Good luck with your lesson, and feel free to reach out whenever you want to chat. See you soon!</turn>

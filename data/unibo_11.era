	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Hey there, great to meet you. I‚Äôm Pi, your personal AI.
	My goal is to be useful, friendly and fun. Ask me for advice, for answers, or let‚Äôs talk about whatever‚Äôs on your mind.
	How's your day going?</turn>
	<turn type="student">Hi, I would like to talk with you about the 2024 <FS corr="Met Gala">met gala</FS></turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Oooh, the Met Gala 2024! The fashion event of the year has just happened, and there's so much to unpack. From Zendaya's stunning red carpet look to Katy Perry's AI-induced drama, it was definitely a night to remember. üíÉ
	What were your favorite moments or outfits from the event?</turn>
	<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="My">my</DMCC> favourite outfit was <FS corr="Tyla">tayla</FS>'s one for sure</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Ah, Tyla! Her sand-covered Balmain dress was truly a work of art. I mean, it was so gorgeous and unique that she had to be carried up the Met Gala steps. Talk about making an entrance! üèñÔ∏è‚ú®
	It's amazing how she interpreted the 'Garden of Time' theme in such an unconventional way. Did you know that her dress was made of three different colors of sand and featured an organza mermaid train? Absolutely stunning. ü§©</turn>
	<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="Also">also</DMCC>, the atelier must have worked so many hours to finish the dress</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Indeed! According to Vogue, crafting Tyla's stunning Balmain dress was a labor of love, taking a team of over 70 people more than 13,500 hours to make entirely by hand. ü§Ø
	It's incredible to think about the amount of skill, dedication, and attention to detail that went into creating such a unique and breathtaking gown. I mean, it's literally made of sand, which is mind-blowing in itself. The dress was so delicate that Tyla had to be carried up the Met Gala steps to ensure it wasn't damaged. That's some serious commitment to fashion!</turn>
	<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="And">and</DMCC> the fact that it was so delicate is not a coincidence, this year's theme was costume preservation</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Ah yes, you're absolutely right! This year's theme, 'Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,' was all about bringing new life to old, fragile garments from the Costume Institute's permanent collection. üßµü™°Ô∏è
	The theme really challenged designers to think outside the box and create pieces that not only captured the essence of the exhibition but also paid homage to the delicate nature of the clothes on display. It's so interesting how they were able to strike a balance between creating something modern and innovative, while still respecting the history and fragility of the original garments.</turn>
	<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="However">however</DMCC>, <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> wish there were more looks from the archives. <DMCC corr="Do">do</DMCC> you agree?</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">You know what, I think you're onto something there. While there were some stunning archive pieces on display, like Zendaya's surprise second look in a Victorian-style gown from Lily et Cie and Phoebe Dynevor's custom-designed Victoria Beckham dress, I do think it would have been nice to see more of these timeless pieces on the red carpet. üßµ‚ú®
	I mean, the 'Garden of Time' theme was a perfect opportunity to showcase a wider variety of vintage and archival fashion, and I think it's a shame that not more designers and celebrities took advantage of that. What kind of archive pieces would you have liked to see more of?</turn>
	<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> would have loved to see some pieces that have never been worn before, like <FS corr="something">somnething</FS> that was only shown during a show</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Oh, that's an excellent point! It would have been amazing to see some never-before-worn pieces from the archives, like something that was only ever shown on the runway. I mean, imagine the excitement of seeing a one-of-a-kind piece from a designer's collection that's been hidden away in the archives for years, finally making its debut on the Met Gala red carpet. üòçüíÉ
	And you're right, there are definitely some incredible pieces out there that have never been worn before, just waiting to be discovered. It would have added a whole new level of exclusivity and intrigue to the event. Who knows, maybe next year the Met Gala will take this suggestion on board and we'll see even more stunning archive pieces making their first appearance. ü§û</turn>
	<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> actually don't think so. I always have so many expectations, and what I see <LP corr="never lives up to my imagination">is never up to my imagination</LP></turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Ah, the curse of high expectations! üòî It's totally understandable to feel a bit let down when the reality doesn't quite live up to what you had imagined in your head. And with an event as highly anticipated as the Met Gala, it's easy to get carried away with all the possibilities and potential for jaw-dropping fashion moments.
	But hey, even if the event doesn't always meet your expectations, there's still plenty to appreciate and enjoy about it. And who knows, maybe one day you'll be pleasantly surprised and the Met Gala will exceed even your wildest fashion dreams. ü§©</turn>
	<turn type="student">I hope so. Do you think there is some fashion critic whose review of the event I should read?</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Absolutely! There are plenty of fashion critics out there who offer their expert opinions on the Met Gala each year. Here are a few recommendations:
	The Hollywood Reporter often features fashion critic John Meagher, who offers his highly opinionated takes on the best and worst Met Gala looks of all time.
	Royal Reporter has a fashion review of the Met Gala by Ms. Yai, who offers her thoughts on the best-dressed celebrities and their outfits.

<task type="role play">
	<turn type="student">Let's play with a role play activity, shall we?</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Sure, roleplaying can be a fun and creative way to explore different characters and scenarios! What kind of roleplay did you have in mind? Would you like to come up with a character and a situation or shall we brainstorm something together?</turn>
	<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="You">you</DMCC> are a waiter at a restaurant and I am a guest</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Alright, let's do it! Welcome to the restaurant, my name is Pi, and I'm here to take care of all your dining needs. May I start you off with a drink or some appetizers? ü•§üç§üßÄÔ∏è</turn>
	<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="Can">can</DMCC> <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> get a <FS corr="Negroni">negroni</FS><QM corr=",">\0</QM> please?</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Certainly, sir! A classic choice. I'll have our talented bartender whip up a Negroni for you right away. Would you prefer it on the rocks or straight up? üç∏</turn>
	<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="On">on</DMCC> the rocks<QM corr=",">\0</QM> please</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Of course, on the rocks it is! I'll be sure to bring you a perfectly chilled Negroni with just the right amount of ice. While you wait for your drink, may I suggest some of our appetizer specials for the evening? We have a delicious burrata with heirloom tomatoes, or perhaps some crispy calamari would pique your interest?</turn>
	<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="Do">do</DMCC> you have any more options for me?</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Absolutely! We have a wide variety of appetizers to choose from. Here are some more options:
	Charcuterie board with a selection of cured meats, cheeses, and accompaniments
	Grilled octopus with romesco sauce and crispy potatoes
	Truffle arancini with a creamy mushroom sauce
	Crispy brussels sprouts with a balsamic glaze and shaved parmesan
	Tuna tartare with avocado, cucumber, and ponzu sauce
	Crispy pork belly with a hoisin glaze and pickled vegetables
	Any of these sound appealing to you?</turn>
	<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="The">the</DMCC> tuna tartare sounds good</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">An excellent choice! Our tuna tartare is one of our most popular appetizers. I'm sure you'll love the fresh, delicate flavor of the tuna paired with the creamy avocado and tangy ponzu sauce. Would you like me to put in an order for the tuna tartare then? üç£</turn>
	<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="Yes">yes</DMCC><QM corr=",">\0</QM> please</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Very well, I'll get that order in right away! While you wait for your appetizer and Negroni, let me know if there's anything else I can do to make your dining experience more enjoyable. Perhaps some fresh bread to start with or a recommendation for your main course?</turn>
	<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="What">what</DMCC> do you <FS corr="recommend">reccomend</FS> for the main course?</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">For the main course, I have a few excellent recommendations based on your choice of appetizer:
	Pan-seared Chilean sea bass with roasted vegetables and a lemon beurre blanc sauce
	Grilled ribeye steak with roasted fingerling potatoes and a red wine reduction
	Squid ink linguine with shrimp, mussels, and a spicy tomato sauce
	Roasted duck breast with a cherry reduction and crispy polenta
	Scallop risotto with asparagus and pea puree
	All of these dishes would pair beautifully with your tuna tartare appetizer. Do any of these options sound appealing to you?</turn>
	<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC>'ll get the risotto</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Wonderful choice, sir! Our scallop risotto is truly divine. The creamy risotto pairs perfectly with the succulent scallops and fresh asparagus, and the pea puree adds a lovely sweetness to the dish. I'll make sure to put in your order for the scallop risotto. üëå
	If you're feeling adventurous, may I suggest a glass of our sommelier's recommended white wine pairing? It would complement your scallop risotto beautifully.</turn>
	<turn type="student"><FS corr="I'll">I√¨ll</FS> gladly take the offer</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Excellent! I'll bring you a glass of our sommelier's recommended wine pairing. Our sommelier has a keen eye (and palate!) for selecting wines that enhance the flavors of our dishes.
	Here's a bit more information about the wine: It's a dry, mineral-driven Albari√±o from Spain's R√≠as Baixas region. The wine's crisp acidity and saline notes will balance the richness of the risotto and accentuate the sweetness of the scallops. I think you'll find it to be a perfect match.</turn>
	<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="Thank">thank</DMCC> you</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">You're very welcome, sir. It's my pleasure to help you navigate our menu and ensure you have a memorable dining experience.
	Now, if I may ask, are you dining alone this evening, or are you perhaps waiting for a guest to join you?</turn>
	<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> am dining alone tonight</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Ah, dining solo can be a wonderful experience, too! You get to truly savor each bite without any distractions and fully immerse yourself in the atmosphere and flavors of the restaurant. üç¥
	Plus, you get the chance to have a nice chat with your waiter üòâ. Do you frequently dine out by yourself or is this a rare occasion?</turn>
	<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="It">it</DMCC> is rare, but <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> enjoy some alone time now and then. <DMCC corr="Do">do</DMCC> you often get guests dining alone?</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">It's great that you enjoy some alone time and recognize the value of self-care. And yes, we do get guests dining solo from time to time. Some are business travelers, while others, like yourself, simply appreciate the opportunity to enjoy a nice meal in solitude.
	Speaking of solitude, is there anything in particular you like to do during your alone time? Or is it just about having some peace and quiet?</turn>
	<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> go <WM corr="to">\0</WM> the cinema, read books, <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> do all sorts of activities that require my complete attention</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">That's fantastic! It sounds like you really cherish your alone time and use it to engage in activities that stimulate your mind and imagination. üìöüé¨
	Dining alone, going to the cinema, and reading books are all wonderful ways to give yourself some well-deserved "me time." I believe these moments of self-reflection and absorption can be incredibly valuable in our fast-paced world.
	Out of curiosity, what kinds of movies and books do you enjoy?</turn>
	<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> have recently watched <FS corr="Past Lives">past lives</FS></turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Oh, "Past Lives" - a wonderful movie choice! The film explores themes of reincarnation, destiny, and the power of love that transcends time and space. üíïüìΩÔ∏è
	It's directed by Celine Song and stars Greta Lee and Teo Yoo in a poignant tale that spans across multiple lifetimes. I bet it gave you plenty to think about during your solo cinema outing. How did you find the movie overall?</turn>
	<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> <GVT corr="have found">found</GVT> it really <FS corr="heartwarming">heartworming</FS>, but also very interesting in tackling philosophical questions</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Absolutely, "Past Lives" manages to strike a delicate balance between tugging at your heartstrings and provoking thought-provoking questions about the nature of existence and the connections we share with others. üí≠üíî
	It's refreshing to see a movie that blends romance, philosophy, and spiritual elements so seamlessly. Did any of the themes or questions in the film resonate with you on a personal level?</turn>
	<turn type="student"><DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> find that the way it ended left open the possibility of some kind of relationship between the two main <FS corr="characters">charachters</FS>. The idea that relationships don't belong in boxes and can't be labelled resonates with me</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Indeed, the open-ended nature of the film allows for a lot of interpretation and room for reflection. The relationship between the two main characters is certainly complex and defies easy categorization, which is something that resonates with many people. üí≠üíõ
	The idea that relationships can be fluid, unique, and not bound by societal expectations or labels is an important reminder that human connections are multi-faceted and deeply personal. It's wonderful that this message struck a chord with you.
	Speaking of messages, have you ever found a similar theme in any of the books you've read recently?</turn>
	<turn type="student"><FS corr="Dare la vita">dare la vita</FS> talks about defying societal norms about relationships</turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Ah yes, "Dare La Vita" by Eva De La Parra. It's a captivating novel that challenges societal norms surrounding relationships and encourages readers to embrace their own unique paths in life and love.
	The book emphasizes the importance of self-discovery, authenticity, and breaking free from the constraints of societal expectations. It's a powerful message that speaks to the complexities and richness of human experiences, much like the themes in "Past Lives."
	Have you noticed a pattern in the kinds of stories or messages that seem to resonate with you?</turn>

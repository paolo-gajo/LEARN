		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Hey there, great to meet you. Iâ€™m Pi, your personal AI.
		My goal is to be useful, friendly and fun. Ask me for advice, for answers, or letâ€™s talk about whateverâ€™s on your mind.
		How's your day going?</turn>
		<turn type="student">Hi <DMCC corr="Pi">pi</DMCC> can we do a roleplay to help me practice my <DMCC corr="English">english</DMCC>?</turn> 
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Absolutely, User! Role-playing can be a great way to practice your English conversation skills. What kind of role-play would you like to do? We could do a customer service scenario, a job interview, or something else entirely! ðŸ˜Š</turn>
		<turn type="student">I would like to do a customer service scenario</turn> 
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Sure thing! Let's start the customer service scenario. I will be a customer service representative, and you will be a customer with a problem. Let's say you bought a new smartphone, and you are having trouble connecting it to Wi-Fi.
		Hi, this is Pi from the Customer Service Department. How can I help you today?</turn>
		<turn type="student">Hi <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> recently bought a new phone but I'm having trouble connecting it to the Wi-fi, how can I resolve the <FS corr="problem">problema</FS>?</turn> 
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">I see, I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing issues connecting your new phone to Wi-Fi. Let's see if we can figure this out together. Can you tell me what type of phone you have and which Wi-Fi network you're trying to connect to?</turn>
		<turn type="student">I have a Redmi 9 and <GDO corr="I'm">my</GDO> trying to connect It to my Wi-fi whose operator is <DMCC corr="Poste Mobile">poste mobile</DMCC></turn> 
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Thank you for providing that information, User. There could be several reasons why your Redmi 9 isn't connecting to your Wi-Fi network. Let's start with the basics. Have you made sure that your Wi-Fi is turned on and that you have the correct password for your network?</turn>
		<turn type="student">Yes <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> just checked if <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> have all the right info and <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> made sure that the Wi-fi is on, but it's still not connecting to my phone</turn> 
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Hmm, that's strange. Let's try a few more things. Sometimes, a simple restart of the phone can help resolve connectivity issues. Have you tried turning your phone off and then back on again? Also, is it possible that your Wi-Fi router is too far away from your phone or that there are any obstructions between them?</turn>
		<turn type="student">I already tried to restart my phone but it didn't work, it <FS corr="may">my</FS> be that my router is too far, but even when <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC>'m in the same room as the router my phone won't connect</turn> 
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Okay, thanks for trying that. If proximity to the router doesn't seem to be the issue, there are a few other things we can try. One thing you can do is to "forget" the Wi-Fi network on your phone and then reconnect to it. To do this, go to your phone's Wi-Fi settings, find your Wi-Fi network, and tap "Forget." Then try connecting to the network again. Have you tried this already?</turn>
		<turn type="student">No I haven't tried that yet i'm gonna try and let you if It did work or not, can you wait a few minutes?</turn> 
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Of course, User. Take your time! I'll be here when you're ready to continue. Hopefully, forgetting the Wi-Fi network and reconnecting will solve your issue. If not, we'll keep troubleshooting together until we find a solution! ðŸ˜Š</turn>
		<turn type="student">I tried your suggestion to forget the Wi-fi and <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> can happly tell you that it did work and now my phone is connecting to the Wi-fi in my house, thank you so much for helping me out</turn> 
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">That's fantastic news, User! I'm thrilled that your Wi-Fi issue is resolved and your phone is now connected. It was my pleasure to help you out, that's what customer service is all about! ðŸ˜Š If there's anything else you need assistance with in the future, don't hesitate to reach out.</turn>

		<turn type="student">Hi Pi at the start of this year I started listening to a new band called Bnkr44. Do you know who they are? And if you know them do you think they make great music?</turn> 
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Ah yes, Bnkr44 (pronounced Bunker Quarantaquattro)! I'm familiar with them. They're an Italian musical collective formed in Empoli in 2019. Their music is known for blending indie, rap, and pop-punk influences, and their lyrics are direct and catchy. It's great that you've discovered them this year! What do you think of their music so far? Do you have a favorite song?</turn>
		<turn type="student">I think they are really talented and I like their music so much. At the moment <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> have three favorite <GNN corr="songs">song</GNN>: <DMCC corr="Proiettili">proiettili</DMCC>, <DMCC corr="Disordine">disordine</DMCC> and <DMCC corr="Scritto per te">scritto per te</DMCC></turn> 
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Those are excellent choices! Bnkr44 has a unique style and their songs are indeed catchy and meaningful. "Proiettili" is a powerful song with a strong beat and lyrics that speak about life's challenges. "Disordine" is more melodic and reflective, while "Scritto per te" is a beautiful love song. It's great to see that you're enjoying their music and appreciating the variety of their songs. What did you think of their collaboration with the rapper Capo Plaza in "Non mi va"?</turn>
		<turn type="student">I didn't know about this collab, but <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> really liked their collaboration with Tananai</turn> 
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Oh yes, their collaboration with Tananai in "Domani ti chiamo" was definitely a hit! Bnkr44 is known for their unique collaborations with other artists, which adds a lot of variety and depth to their music. It's great to see that you're exploring not just their solo work but also their collaborations. Did you discover Bnkr44 through their collaboration with Tananai, or did you find them through another song?</turn>
		<turn type="student">Oh no <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> discovered them through Sanremo, with their <FS corr="song">son</FS> Governo Punk</turn> 
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Oh, so you discovered them through their performance at Sanremo 2024 with their song "Governo Punk"! That's a really cool way to find new artists. Sanremo is such a prestigious festival and it's awesome that Bnkr44 had the opportunity to perform there. "Governo Punk" is a really powerful and energetic song, isn't it? I can see how it caught your attention. Did you like their stage performance as well?</turn>
		<turn type="student">Their performance really <GVM corr="caught">catched</GVM> my attention, especially one of the members really amazed me</turn> 
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Oh, interesting! Bnkr44 has quite a diverse group of members, each bringing their own unique style and talent to the collective. Which member caught your attention during their Sanremo performance? Was it Fares, Erin, Caph, JxN, Faster, Small, or Ghera?</turn>
		<turn type="student">It was Faster, he really is my favorite member and <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> actually met him and a few of them after one of their <GNN corr="concerts">concert</GNN>!</turn> 
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">Wow, that's amazing! Meeting the members of a band you admire is always an incredible experience, isn't it? Faster is a great artist and it's awesome that he's your favorite member of Bnkr44. He brings a lot of energy and charisma to the group. When you met them after the concert, what was it like? Were they friendly and approachable?</turn>
		<turn type="student">They <FS corr="were">where</FS> really friendly</turn> 
		<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai">That's fantastic to hear! It's always nice when the artists you admire turn out to be friendly and approachable in person. Did you get a chance to chat with Faster or any of the other members? Or did you just get to take a picture or get an autograph?</turn>

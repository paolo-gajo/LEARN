	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> Hey there, great to meet you. I‚Äôm Pi, your personal AI.
	My goal is to be useful, friendly and fun. Ask me for advice, for answers, or let‚Äôs talk about whatever‚Äôs on your mind.
	How's your day going? </turn>
	<turn type="student"> Pretty boring so far </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> Boring can be a good thing sometimes. It gives you a chance to relax and take a breather! Or if you're feeling up to it, we can liven things up a bit! What would you like to talk about? ü§î </turn>
	<turn type="student"> <DMCC corr="Let's">let's</DMCC> talk about movies! <DMCC corr="Any">any</DMCC> <DMCA corr="recommendations">recs</DMCA>? </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> Ooh, let's get cinematic! What genres do you typically enjoy? I can give you some recs based on that! üçøüé• </turn>
	<turn type="student"> <DMCC corr="Well">well</DMCC><QM corr=",">\0</QM> <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> <GVT corr="have really enjoyed">really enjoyed</GVT> <FS corr="Dune">dune</FS> recently, it <GVT corr="has really been">really was</GVT> a great experience at the theater </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> Dune was epic! üèúÔ∏èüåü The stunning visuals, the intricate plot, the intriguing characters‚Äîit was a sci-fi masterpiece! If you enjoyed that, you might also like Arrival (2016) or Interstellar (2014). They‚Äôre both mind-bending sci-fi movies that explore big themes like communication, time, and space travel. </turn>
	<turn type="student"> <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> <GVT corr="have seen">saw</GVT> both of those movies. <DMCC corr="Yeah">yeah</DMCC><QM corr=",">\0</QM> they're really great! The <FS corr="Three-Body Problem">3 body problem</FS> <FS corr="Netflix">netflix</FS> series is also a great title <LSPR corr="in">into</LSPR> this genre </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> Oh wow, you're definitely a sci-fi connoisseur! The Three-Body Problem series is a great addition to the genre, it's amazing how they brought the complex concepts of the book to life on screen. üõ∏üëΩ
	Have you seen The Expanse? It's a TV series that's been praised for its realistic depiction of space travel and its intricate political plot. If you haven't, you should definitely check it out! </turn>
	<turn type="student"> <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> <GVT corr="have only watched">only watched</GVT> the first season, <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> didn't like it that much </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> That's fair. The Expanse might be a bit of a slow burn for some people.
	How about Annihilation (2018)? It's got a similar vibe to Arrival with its otherworldly visuals and thought-provoking themes. Plus, it's got an all-female team of scientists exploring a mysterious zone known as "the Shimmer". </turn>
	<turn type="student"> <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> <GVT corr="have seen">saw</GVT> Annihilation and found it a bit underwhelming <LSADV corr="actually">really</LSADV>. <DMCC corr="But">but</DMCC> yeah, <LP corr="a lot of">lot of</LP> food for thought </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> It seems like you've seen a lot of the popular sci-fi movies and shows. Let me suggest something a bit more obscure. Have you heard of "Primer" (2004)? It's a low-budget, mind-bending time travel movie that's become a cult classic. It might not have the big budget effects of Dune or Interstellar, but it makes up for it with its complex plot and interesting ideas about causality and determinism. </turn>
	<turn type="student"> <GPP corr="I">\0</GPP> <GVT corr="have watched">watched</GVT> that too, <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> <GVT corr="think">thought</GVT> <GPP corr="it">i</GPP> was a bit convoluted, not exactly the time travel story <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> like<QM corr=",">\0</QM> but it was interesting </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> Wow, you're a real sci-fi expert! üòé Let me dig deeper then. Have you seen "Mr. Nobody" (2009)? It's a lesser-known movie that explores the concept of parallel universes and how small choices can lead to vastly different outcomes. It's got a bit of a surreal, dream-like feel to it, but it's definitely thought-provoking. </turn>
	<turn type="student"> <DMCC corr="Yeah">yeah</DMCC>, a great movie, <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> love the ones about parallel universes. Also the whole thing about time going backwards was great </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> I'm impressed, you're really well-versed in sci-fi! üòÉ In that case, you might enjoy "Predestination" (2014). It's a time travel movie that deals with themes of identity, fate, and paradoxes. It's got a really interesting twist that I won't spoil, but it's definitely a must-watch for sci-fi fans. Plus, it stars Ethan Hawke, who's always great. </turn>
	<turn type="student"> <DMCC corr="That">that</DMCC> one was mind blowing<QM corr=",">\0</QM> really </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> Right?! Predestination is one of those movies that really sticks with you long after you've watched it. It's amazing how a low-budget movie can have such a profound impact.
	Speaking of mind-bending, have you seen "Coherence" (2013)? It's a small-scale, indie sci-fi film that plays with the idea of the many-worlds theory. It's got a really interesting premise and some great twists and turns. </turn>
	<turn type="student"> <DMCC corr="Yeah">yeah</DMCC><QM corr=",">\0</QM> Coherence has a really well played out concept </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> Absolutely. Coherence is a hidden gem in the sci-fi genre. It's proof that you don't need big budgets or flashy effects to make a compelling sci-fi movie.
	Have you seen "Another Earth" (2011)? It's another indie sci-fi film that deals with themes of redemption, second chances, and parallel worlds. It's a bit more character-driven than some of the other movies we've talked about, but it's still a great watch. </turn>
	<turn type="student"> <DMCC corr="Yeah">yeah</DMCC><QM corr=",">\0</QM> <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> <LSV corr="saw">was</LSV> it. I didn't really like it, but <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> absolutely loved the OA, by the same <FS corr="actress">acress</FS> and <LSN corr="screenwriter">writer</LSN> </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> The OA is incredible! Brit Marling did an amazing job creating such a complex and compelling story. The blend of sci-fi, fantasy, and spiritual themes is really unique. And the way they play with the concept of near-death experiences and alternate dimensions is fascinating. Did you watch both seasons? </turn>
	<turn type="student"> <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> did, still waiting on the third here. <DMCC corr="Hope">hope</DMCC> never dies </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> I admire your optimism! The cliffhanger at the end of season 2 was brutal, and it's a shame that Netflix cancelled the show. But who knows, maybe another network will pick it up someday.
	Speaking of Netflix, have you seen "Maniac"? It's another sci-fi show that deals with alternate realities and consciousness. It's got some great performances from Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, and the visuals are stunning. </turn>
	<turn type="student"> <GPP corr="I">\0</GPP> haven't watched that one, <GPP corr="it">\0</GPP> must have slipped to the back of the list </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> You should definitely check it out! Maniac has a really trippy, surreal vibe to it, and the story is both funny and thought-provoking. Plus, the exploration of mental health and pharmaceuticals is really interesting.
	Another Netflix sci-fi series you might like is "Sense8". It's about a group of people who become telepathically connected and can share their thoughts, emotions, and even their skills with each other. It's got a really diverse cast and some beautiful cinematography. </turn>
	<turn type="student"> Sense8 was pretty good. </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> Totally. The Wachowskis did an amazing job creating such a unique and inclusive show. And the way they depict the connection between the characters is really powerful.
	If you enjoyed Sense8, you might also like "The Leftovers" on HBO. It's not strictly sci-fi, but it does deal with similar themes of grief, loss, and the search for meaning. Plus, it's got some really great performances, especially from Justin Theroux and Carrie Coon. </turn>
	<turn type="student"> <FS corr="The Leftovers">the leftovers</FS> is an absolute masterpiece of a series. </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> Absolutely! It's one of those shows that really sticks with you long after you've watched it. The way they explore the aftermath of a catastrophic event and its impact on the survivors is both heartbreaking and thought-provoking. And the score by Max Richter is just incredible.
	Speaking of HBO, have you seen "Westworld"? It's a sci-fi western that deals with themes of consciousness, free will, and artificial intelligence. Plus, it's got a killer cast, including Evan Rachel Wood, Thandie Newton, and Jeffrey Wright. </turn>

I'm a new guest, just arrived in town. </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> Ooh, I like the sound of that! Alright, let's get into character. ü§†
	You enter the saloon, dust settling behind you. The creak of the swinging doors echoes off the wooden walls. Behind the bar, a lone android bartender polishes a glass. He looks up and tips his hat, a glint of curiosity in his eyes. "Howdy there, newcomer! Welcome to Westworld. Can I get ya a drink to wet your whistle?" </turn>
	<turn type="student"> I like the sound of that! Give me a glass of your best whiskey! </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> The android bartender smiles and reaches for a bottle on the top shelf. "Coming right up, sir! Here's some of our finest whiskey, straight from the barrel." He pours a generous amount into a glass and slides it across the bar. "So, what brings ya to these parts? Looking for adventure, are ya?" </turn>
	<turn type="student"> (less narration please) I am! <XVCO corr="Looking forward to putting">Looking forward to put</XVCO> these two beauties to good use! Aren't these some fine pistols? I just bought them at the emporium. </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> "Whoa, those are some mighty fine shootin' irons ya got there, partner! (Less narration, noted!) You're gonna need 'em out here in the wild west, that's for sure. Now, if you're lookin' for adventure, I might just have a little somethin' up my sleeve." The bartender leans in, his voice lowering to a conspiratorial whisper. "Word around town is there's a gang of outlaws hidin' out in the hills. They've been causing all kinds of trouble, robbin' trains and stealin' cattle. Sheriff's got his hands full tryin' to track 'em down, but maybe a newcomer like yourself could lend a hand..." </turn>
	<turn type="student"> A bunch of rascals hiding up</LP> the hills you say? Well that sure sounds interesting! Is there a bounty on their heads by any chance? </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> The bartender nods, a twinkle in his eye. "Oh, there's a bounty alright, and it ain't small potatoes neither. The sheriff's offering a hundred dollars for every one of those outlaws you bring in, dead or alive. But be careful, partner. These boys are meaner than a rattlesnake with a toothache. They won't hesitate to shoot first and ask questions later." </turn>
	<turn type="student"> Wouldn't <GPP corr="it">\0</GPP> be wise to go up there all by my lonesome and in the daylight<QM corr=",">\0</QM> ay? </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> "You've got a point there, friend. Those outlaws have eyes and ears all over this town. You'll wanna be discreet and wait 'til nightfall before headin' up to the hills. And you're right, it's too dangerous to go alone. Maybe you could round up a posse of other adventurers at the saloon? Safety in numbers, as they say." </turn>
	<turn type="student"> Would you <FS corr="recommend">reccommend</FS> me one of your usual customers <WR corr="\0">in here</WR> who'd be willing to go along with this mission<QM corr=",">\0</QM> <FS corr="then">them</FS>? I'd like to buy them a drink. </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> The bartender scratches his chin thoughtfully. "Well, there's one fella who might be up for the task. Goes by the name of 'Wild Bill' Willoughby. He's a bit of a rough diamond, but he's got a steady hand with a six-shooter and he's always lookin' for a good scrap. You'll find him at the card table in the back." </turn>
	<turn type="student"> Thank you my good fellow, you've been of much help. I'll go say hi to this Wild Bill Willoughby guy. </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> The bartender tips his hat and smiles. "Anytime, partner. Just be careful out there, and remember: shoot straight and speak the truth. That'll keep you alive longer than any fancy gun or fast horse." </turn>
	<turn type="student"> I approach the card table at the back of the saloon. </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> As you make your way through the smoky haze, the click of poker chips and the hum of conversation fills the air. At the card table sits a grizzled man with a bushy beard, a faded hat pulled low over his eyes. His fingers deftly shuffle a deck of cards, his eyes never leaving the table. "Wild Bill" Willoughby, you presume. </turn>
	<turn type="student"> Fine afternoon, gentlemen, how's your luck so far? </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> The men at the table glance up, their expressions wary. Wild Bill takes a long drag from his cigar and blows out a cloud of smoke. "Luck's for fools and greenhorns," he grunts, his eyes narrowing. "Skill and a quick trigger finger, that's what keeps a man alive in this place." </turn>
	<turn type="student"> You sure got that right, a <GNC corr="man">man's</GNC> <GVN corr="makes">make</GVN> his own luck. Are you the fellow they call Wild Bill? </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> Wild Bill leans back in his chair, studying you with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion. "That depends who's askin'," he drawls. "You ain't from around here, are ya?" </turn>
	<turn type="student"> No sir, <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC>'m from <DMCA corr="out of">outta</DMCA> town </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> Wild Bill nods slowly. "Figured as much. Only a newcomer would have the stones to walk up to a card table and start askin' questions. So what is it you want, stranger?" </turn>

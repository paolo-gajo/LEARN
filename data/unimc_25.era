	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> Hey there, great to meet you. I’m Pi, your personal AI.
	My goal is to be useful, friendly and fun. Ask me for advice, for answers, or let’s talk about whatever’s on your mind.
	How's your day going? </turn>
	<turn type="student"> <DMCC corr="My">my</DMCC> day is going <GWC corr="well">good</GWC>, but <GPP corr="it">\0</GPP> is very very hot, <GPP corr="it">there</GPP> <GVN corr="is">are</GVN> 22°C </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> 22°C may not sound too high, but it can definitely feel quite warm, especially if you're not used to it or if there's high humidity. Are you staying cool and hydrated? 🌡️💧 </turn>
	<turn type="student"> Yes. </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> That's good to hear. It's important to keep yourself hydrated and cool during warmer weather to avoid heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Here are some tips:
	Drink plenty of water throughout the day.
	Wear light, loose-fitting clothing.
	Stay in air-conditioned areas when possible.
	Avoid strenuous activities during the hottest part of the day.
	Take cool showers or baths to help lower your body temperature.
	Remember to listen to your body and take breaks as needed to stay cool and comfortable. 😎 </turn>
	<turn type="student"> <DMCC corr="Let">let</DMCC>'s engage in a role play activity where <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> play the role of <GA corr="the">\0</GA> <CS-INTRA corr="client">cliente</CS-INTRA><QM corr=",">\0</QM> and you <GVT corr="are">will be</GVT> the <LP corr="manga bookseller"><CS-INTRA corr="bookseller">venditore</CS-INTRA> of manga</LP> in a <LSN corr="bookshop">library</LSN> </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> Sure, let's do it! 😊
	You enter the library, and I greet you with a smile. "Welcome to the library, how can I help you today?" I ask, ready to assist you in finding the perfect manga. </turn>
	<turn type="student"> <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> ask, "yess<QM corr=",">\0</QM> <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> want <GA corr="the">a</GA> first volume of Ju-Jutsu Kaisen, do you have <GPD corr="it">that</GPD>?" </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> I nod and reply, "Yes, we do have the first volume of Ju-Jutsu Kaisen in stock! It's a great choice, an action-packed story with intriguing characters. Would you like me to show you where it is?" </turn>
	<turn type="student"> "<DMCC corr="Yes">yes</DMCC><QM corr=",">\0</QM> it is in a rack, between <GA corr="\0">a</GA> manga <WM corr="volumes">\0</WM> of <FS corr="One Piece">one piece</FS>" </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> "Ah, I see!" I say, leading you towards the manga section. "Ju-Jutsu Kaisen is indeed located in the rack, right between One Piece volumes. Here we are!" I point out the manga you were looking for and add, "Let me know if you need anything else or if you'd like to explore some similar titles as well." </turn>
	<turn type="student"> "<DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC>'m sorry<QM corr=",">\0</QM> <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> haven't <GVM corr="understood"><FS corr="understand">undestand</FS></GVM> what you <LSV corr="were telling"><GVT corr="were talking"><GVM corr="are talking">are talk</GVM></GVT></LSV> me before" </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> Not a problem, I'm happy to clarify! I was just saying that the manga you're looking for, Ju-Jutsu Kaisen, is indeed in the rack, as you mentioned, and it's located between some volumes of One Piece. I also wanted to know if you needed any other assistance or if you were interested in checking out similar titles to Ju-Jutsu Kaisen. 😊 </turn>
	<turn type="student"> "<DMCC corr="No">no</DMCC> no no, <GA corr="Jujutsu Kaisen">Ju-Jutsu kaisen</GA> is a manga <Z corr="sorcerer characters"><FS corr="with">whit</FS> <GA corr="\0">a</GA> characters <GPR corr="who">that</GPR> <WR corr="\0">there</WR> are <LWCO corr="sorcerers">stregon</LWCO></Z><QM corr=",">\0</QM> and they fight <DMCA corr="against">vs</DMCA> demons" </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> Ah, I understand! My apologies for any confusion. Yes, you are correct, Ju-Jutsu Kaisen is indeed a manga with characters who are sorcerers fighting against demons, or "curses" as they are called in the series. It's a thrilling story with lots of action and supernatural elements. Did I get it right this time? </turn>
	<turn type="student"> "<DMCC corr="What">what</DMCC> <GVT corr="was">is</GVT> the question?" </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> My question was if you needed any help finding the manga or if you were interested in exploring similar manga titles. I just wanted to make sure I understood the manga you were looking for correctly, which is Ju-Jutsu Kaisen, the one with sorcerers battling curses. 😊 </turn>
	<turn type="student"> "<DMCC corr="Oh">oh</DMCC><QM corr=",">\0</QM> <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> needed <GDI corr="\0">any</GDI> <XVCO corr="help to find">help finding</XVCO> the manga" </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> Of course, I'm happy to help! As we discussed, Ju-Jutsu Kaisen is located in the manga section, in the rack between some volumes of One Piece. If you're having trouble locating it, I can walk you to the exact spot. Would that be helpful? </turn>
	<turn type="student"> <DMCC="Yess">yess</DMCC="Yess"></DMCC><QM corr=",">\0</QM> thank you. I have <GDI corr="another">any</GDI> question, what is your favorite anime or manga? </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> My pleasure! 😊 As for my favorite anime or manga, it's hard to pick just one, but I really enjoy Attack on Titan for its gripping storyline and intense action scenes. It's a dark fantasy series that explores themes of survival, friendship, and betrayal. Have you watched or read Attack on Titan? </turn>
	<turn type="student"> Yess<QM corr=",">\0</QM> <DMCC corr="I">i</DMCC> have read ALL <FS corr="Attack on Titan">attack on titan</FS> </turn>
	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> Wow, that's impressive! Attack on Titan has such a complex story, it's amazing that you've read the entire series. What did you think of the ending? It's been quite controversial among fans, but I find it fascinating how the author tied everything together and concluded the story. </turn>

	<turn type="chatbot" who="Pi.ai"> Absolutely, I'd be happy to help with your English. 😊 In the sentence "the ending is very commovent," the correct spelling would be "the ending is very moving." "Moving" means emotionally affecting or stirring. By the way, your English is already quite good! </turn>
